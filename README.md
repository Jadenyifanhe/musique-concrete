# Overview

This is the project repository for CMU 10-615 Art and Machine Learning Project 3. In this project, we created a music concrete using NSynth, a deep learning enhanced sound synthesis model, and Wav2Clip, an audio-to-image model. Through our work, we seek to explore the themes of fusion and transmutation.

**Models:**
We applied the [NSynth model](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/nsynth) developed by Magenta using this [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/nsynth/nsynth.ipynb#scrollTo=mPwQYyYgBkdp). We applied [Ho-Hsiang Wu's implementation](https://github.com/descriptinc/lyrebird-wav2clip) of [Wav2Clip](https://descriptinc.github.io/lyrebird-wav2clip/).

**Datasets:**
The sounds we used in this project were manually selected from the [ESC-50 Dataset](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) and from [FreeSound.org](https://freesound.org/).
